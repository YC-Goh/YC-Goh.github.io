#   Monthly Notes

Not a dumping ground.
This is intended to be a posting ground for hobby analysis / analytics projects 
(whatever the big difference between the two terms).

Also then conveniently a place to test and eventually implement CI / CD.
Most likely the analytics will be done on Python and / or Julia since that's what I'm familiar with.

##  Updating

Notes will be updated throughout the month as well.
But some set-up time and testing time is needed.
Most likely will start on this proper at the same time as transiting to the Main / Dev workflow
since stuff related to this section is most likely to break everything.
