|  [Japan condemns Israel's attack on Iran for 'escalating situation'](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20250613/p2g/00m/0na/029000c)  |  Obviously. Who is Japan in the backyard of?  |
|  [Commentary: North Korea will never denuclearise, after Israel strikes on Iran](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/israel-iran-attack-nuclear-weapons-damage-north-korea-5183166)  |  Really happy that my views aligns with a better-known IR Political Scientist.  |
|  [A New War or a New Stage in an Ongoing War - Observations on June 13 Israeli Attack against Iran](https://www.justsecurity.org/114641/israel-iran-un-charter-jus-ad-bellum)  |  Historical context only magically matters when the Jewish Republic says it does, and not for instance in the case of the Gaza War.  |
|  [Indefensible: Israel's Unlawful Attack on Iran](https://www.justsecurity.org/115010/israel-unlawful-attack-iran-charter)  |  The Jewish Republic cares about International Law?  |
|  [The Right Path to Regime Change in Iran](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/iran/right-path-regime-change-iran)  |  Notice that the core argument is now "the ends justifies the means".  |
|  [What Regime Change Means in Iran](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/19/what-regime-change-means-in-iran/)  |  Duh. But also, anyone who thought that the Jewish Republic _actually wants_ a democratic Iran is... if they have a PhD, please return it.  |
