|  [Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo)  |  Times when such reforms had a realistic chance in hell to pass are likely long over now.  |
|  [The 'sacrifice zone': villagers resist the EU's green push for lithium mining](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/21/lithium-mining-sacrifice-zone-portuguese-villagers-eu-energy-transition)  |  Too bad, this did not need to happen if the world didn't get spooked by weaponised global supply chains.  |

|  [Britain has escalated the global nuclear arms race](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/08/uk-strategic-defence-review-nuclear-arms-race-armageddon)  |  The political left keeps pining for long-lost battles instead of fighting the current war.  |

##  EU Foreign Policy

|  [EU bars Chinese firms from major state medical equipment contracts](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/eu-bars-china-firms-major-state-medical-equipment-contracts-5193851)  |  The protectionism he-said-she-said... may actually be the least important reason for the restrictions.  |
