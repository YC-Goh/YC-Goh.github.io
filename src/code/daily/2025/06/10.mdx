|  \{w-1/3\}Link  |  TL;DR  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [The 'death of creativity'? AI job fears stalk advertising industry](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/09/ai-advertising-industry-google-facebook-meta-ads)  |  Reminder that technology does not need to attain human-level task flexibility to completely upend the labour market.  |
|  [Start-up FutureHouse debuts powerful AI 'reasoning model' for science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01753-1)  |  For anyone wondering why so much money is going into killing \"good\" jobs, reminder that high wages means high labour costs.  |
|  [Russia could be ready to attack Nato within five years, says secretary general](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/09/nato-chief-russia-quantum-leap-defence)  |  Okay in the absence of context. But does the US actually really care about Europe's security?  |
|  [Not even an impeachment could dislodge South Korean right-wing voters](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/south-korea-election-lee-jae-myung-democracy-polarisation-yoon-suk-yeol-5168856)  |  Commentary, but based on actual data. When a people actively express a preference for authoritarianism, do they still deserve freedom and democracy?  |
|  [The scientists warning the world about ocean acidification](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/09/the-scientists-warning-the-world-about-ocean-acidification-evil-twin-of-the-climate-crisis)  |  Does anyone really care about sustainability and climate change anymore?  |
