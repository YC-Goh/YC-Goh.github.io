#   Resting Weekend was a Lie

At least coding this website was fun, if completely an amateur project just for self-amusement and learning. 
Unlike the other thing I had to do for work.
And then some.

##  Painting a Narrative

|  \{w-1/3\}Link  |  TL;DR  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Presidential Memoranda to approve use of US Armed Forces against American protesters, labeling riots as an act of rebellion](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1l67snm/presidential_memoranda_to_approve_use_of_us_armed)  |  Whatever happens next, life will be more interesting (but not better).  |
|  [How the Proposed State Department Reorganization Guts U.S. Human Rights Diplomacy](https://www.justsecurity.org/114200/state-department-reorganization-human-rights)  |  The final conclusion reeks of PolSci and IR fantasists who still believe that the current US regime is Just Another Administration.  |
|  [Britain has escalated the global nuclear arms race](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/08/uk-strategic-defence-review-nuclear-arms-race-armageddon)  |  Opinion, not news, which I've been avoiding. Still, this shit is emblematic of the political left's pining for long-lost battles instead of fighting the larger war.  |
|  [Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo)  |  Related to Jus Soli vs Jus Sanguinis. Times when such reforms had a realistic chance in hell to pass are likely long over now.  |
|  [Trump moves to slash NSF: why are the proposed budget cuts so big?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01749-x)  |  Too many truly believe that the state should \"only fund useful science\". They probably also believe that state industrial strategy can pick winners... right?  |
|  [Anthropic researchers predict a 'pretty terrible decade' for humans as AI could wipe out white collar jobs](https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1l5spw3/anthropic_researchers_predict_a_pretty_terrible)  |  Unclear why so many commentators think this prediction is rubbish just because GenAI doesn't deliver perfect work (as if most humans can either...).  |
|  [Learning From Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution and in the Age of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091823-025129)  |  More people need to hear the real story of what happened to cotton weavers when the production of cotton textiles was automated (made very efficient).  |
