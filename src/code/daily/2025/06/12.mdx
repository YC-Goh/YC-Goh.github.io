#   Wish it Rained at Night, Overnight

UK Autumn all-evening drizzles would suit this country so well.
Add in songs for the mood:
Fragrance.
Running through the rain.
Are you well.
Snow Rain.

Well... it's nice to dream.

##  Speculation

### [The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking?utm_source=alphasignal)

1.  Not a surprise to those who still keep in mind that the underlying engines of RAGs and Reasoning Models are LLMs,
    which are fundamentally still next-word prediciton tokens.
2.  Brings to mind Anthropic AI research that showed that 
    [activation regions in LLMs correspond to logical semantic spaces](https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model),
    and that deactivating certain regions meaningfully alters LLM outputs.
3.  Neither of these actually come to mean that LLMs develop logical reasoning as an emergent property.
4.  Very likely, what happens is that suppose we have an out-of-sample test T with expected answer Z,
    there are insufficient similar examples in the training to infer Z, resulting in hallucination Y.
    -   Now suppose we instead ask the model to "reason it out".
    -   There are sufficient training examples for model to construct "reasoning steps" \{ R \} from T.
    -   There are sufficient training examples for each r in \{ R \} to map to interim solution z.
    -   Given z1, z2, ..., zR, there are sufficient training examples to map zR to final solution Z.
5.  Still, despite being not "true" reasoning
    (like, do most humans actually do better than this?),
    this is already sufficiently useful for many real-world needs
    especially in the vast majority of cognitive work that deals with in-sample problems
    that are often farmed out to lower-ranked / lower-waged workers.
    Some reminders:
    -   "Computer" was once an actual human semi-skilled profession,
        not the machines we use today.
    -   "Typist" was once a relatively widespread semi-skilled profession,
        basically a machine-era analogue of the Scrivener profession,
        which became largely obsolete with modern computers and word processor software.

##  New Outstanding

-   Maybe (just, maybe) add KaTeX integration.
    -   If so, then convert all usage of math to TeX.
