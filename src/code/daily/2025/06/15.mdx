|  [Israel warns 'Tehran will burn' after wave of Iranian missile fire](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-warns-tehran-will-burn-after-wave-of-iranian-missile-fire)  |  Do states fighting existential wars of self-defence usually threaten to annihilate capital cities?  |
|  [Minnesota state lawmaker killed and another injured in targeted shootings](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgj83q2e562o)  |  These headlines are absolutely going to facilitate misinformation.  |
|  [Here's what to expect at the Army's 250th anniversary parade on Trump's birthday](https://apnews.com/article/military-parade-army-trump-f56795c86d802e1c4d40c4de5b001db5)  |  Trash piece reads like a tourist brochure. Also, is the 250th anniversary the actual reason for the parade?  |
|  [Companies Bragging About Their AI Furious as Job Applicants Use AI During Interviews](https://futurism.com/companies-bragging-ai-job-applicants)  |  The faster AI wrecks the current decentralised labour market system, the faster something better can arise from its ashes.  |
|  [People Are Becoming Obsessed with ChatGPT and Spiraling Into Severe Delusions](https://futurism.com/chatgpt-mental-health-crises)  |  This is quite funny since it implies that OpenAI's training data has more fiction and social media than actual psychotherapy, and there's either no proper tagging or no way to use those tags for end-user usage.  |
