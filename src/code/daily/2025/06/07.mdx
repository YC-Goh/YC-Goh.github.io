#   First Post

Hello!
The components for dynamic pages are finally mostly in place now.
Really took a while to figure out how to convert a directory tree into a nested list to create the navigation sidebar.

##  Remaining Things Not Done

-   No scrolling behaviour.
-   No footer.
-   Header will not persist at top if scrolling (if this is a desirable behaviour, that is).
-   Not all MDX components styles defined.
