#   F-ed Day at Work

But when is it not a flaming disaster anyway?
Happy days.

##  Painting a Narrative

|  \{w-1/3\}Link  |  TL;DR  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [RFK Jr. removes every member of CDC vaccine advisory committee](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-removes-members-cdc-immunization-advisory-committee-acip)  |  "We need to restore trust in \_\_\_" _always_ sounds great in the absence of context. _Why_ was the trust "broken"? _How_ was the trust "broken"? _Who_ lost trust? _What_ is the plan to "restore" trust?  |
|  [Trump to California: Surrender](https://time.com/7292344/trump-to-california-surrender-protests-riot)  |  "Order will be restored, ..." Again, uncontroversial take _without context_. Law and order is a good thing, right? _Define_ "Order".  |
|  [Donald Trump gives chilling insurrection warning as protests spark around US: "We are not playing around"](https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1l8442s/donald_trump_gives_chilling_insurrection_warning)  |  Funnily enough, insurrection is genuinely American DNA. The existence of the whole bloody country is due to an armed insurrection that succeeded.  |
|  [We published real photos of troops sleeping on a floor in L.A. Right-wing critics called them fake](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1l8mi6y/we_published_real_photos_of_troops_sleeping_on_a)  |  The political left _doesn't get it_. "Fake news" is a dog whistle. _Define_ fake.  |
|  [Hegseth Testifies That He Doesnâ€™t Know What Legal Authority Trump Is Using To Deploy Troops](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1l89ll8/hegseth_testifies_that_he_doesnt_know_what_legal)  |  Fool me twice... maybe the political left is genuinely retarded. "Follow the law": _Define_ which "law". Or, maybe, _whose_ "law".  |
|  [ Trump team set to destroy $12m worth of HIV drugs and contraceptives that were bought before closing USAID](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1l84lcd/trump_team_set_to_destroy_12m_worth_of_hiv_drugs)  |  Thrice is a hat trick. This is why the political left just doesn't win elections in the USA. Too stupid to deserve power. Did the left _really_ believe that the political right genuinely cared about savings?  |
