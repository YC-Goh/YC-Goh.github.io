#   Weekly Notes

Also a dumping ground.
Mostly a place to write down actual thoughts about current events.
With a good dose of self-censorship thrown in...
ironically not due to anything legally but because I need to keep my job and paycheck to sustain my real hobbies...

##  Updating

Notes will actually be updated throughout the week, not one-shot end-of-week thing.
Will try to set past weeks' stuff in stone, but may still update for errors and refactoring.
