#   Men are genuine assholes

##  Men vote right-wing and then blame liberals and feminists

##  Right-wing arguments are all rhetoric

|  \{w-1/3\}Technique  |  Core argument  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  In-Group vs Out-Group  |  Badly-behaved men are exceptions but badly-behaved women represent _all_ women.  |
|  Strawmanning  |  Treat "men are [insert adjective]" statements as absolute assertions and they become trivially absurd, without needing to argue against the core argument (which is some variation of "most / too many men are assholes").  |
|  Hypocrisy  |  Expect women to understand your personal circumstances but offer none of this treatment in return.  |
|  "But I'm different!"  |  I can also claim that my great-grandfather is Sun Yat-Sen and my grandmother owns this street.  |
|  Fallacy of Composition  |  Yesterday some women said I should cry more and today some women laughed at me for crying. Are these the same women?  |
|  Avoiding Onus of Responsibility  |  Why is it always framed as women need to treat men better for men to stop treating women like shit and voting against their rights?  |
|  Irrelevant Conclusion  |  Sure, some women also voted against womens' rights. Some Jews also supported Hitler. Doesn't change the fact that _on average_ and _on balance_, men are _overall responsible_ for heralding the era of rolling back womens' (and LGBTQ+) rights.  |
