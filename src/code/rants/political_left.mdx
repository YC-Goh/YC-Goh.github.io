##  Misunderstanding Right-wing politics

|  \{w-1/3\}Fronted Issue  |  Technique / Actual Target  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  Fraud and waste  |  [Example](https://old.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1l5a2ln/former_doge_engineer_says_federal_waste_and_fraud/) ([article](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/02/nx-s1-5417994/former-doge-engineer-shares-his-experience-working-for-the-cost-cutting-unit)). The actual goal is "stop giving money to the _undeserving_". Do you know who the _undeserving_ are?  |
|  Foreign infiltration of universities  |  [Example](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4zpnl2x3eo) ([actual target](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/04/03/trump-attacking-universities-funding-us-politics/)). The actual goal is to suppress select universities by designating them as _national security threats_. Who fact checks that the school was indeed a threat?  |

|  [Right-wing censorship is the fault of the left](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-attack-on-harvard-marks-new-phase-in-the-culture-war.html) because the left did it first  |  In this worldview where the Left and Right play a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma with Tit-for-Tat, _how sure_ are people that the Left "defected" first?  |
