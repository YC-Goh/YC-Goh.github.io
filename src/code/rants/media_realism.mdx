#   Diversity in fiction is _great_

##  Realism is retarded and boring

-   Fiction is fiction because it's not supposed to be completely realistic.
-   I want to see _what I want to see_ in media, not myself, and not history.

### Why do Incels and cis-straight-extremists need more of these?

|  \{w-1/3\}What they want  |  Who the fuck cares?  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  Straight "manly" male / "feminine" female leads  |  Wait, real-life is not enough for you?  |
|  ... to admire  |  Just hit the gym. Lol.  |
|  ... to self-insert  |  Just learn to talk to your colleagues or people at the local bar or gym. Lol.  |
|  ... to chase  |  Learn to chat and make friends first. Lol.  |
|  "Historical accuracy"  |  Just visit your library's non-fiction section. Lol.  |

##  These goalposts have legs

-   The biggest tell that assholes are moving goalposts is this discussion pattern:
    -   "I don't mind / am not against / totally support the [insert thing] but..."
    -   Commonly fronted reasons:
        1.  Gameplay sucks because [insert totally original critique].
        2.  Story sucks because [insert totally original critique].
-   The usual rational response is this, but there's a reason it doesn't work for such cases:
    -   Just don't read / watch / play this thing.
    -   Reason it doesn't work is that assholes aren't actually sharing their opinion,
        but are trying to tank and censor media they don't like.

### Commonly cited reasons are stupid

|  \{w-1/3\}What they say  |  Who the fuck cares?  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  The homosexuality is forced  |  All the heterosexuals are also fucking forced. The story didn't need any of the straights to be straight to story the story.  |
|  The gay relationship is forced  |  All the straight relationships are also fucking forced. A story with two male / female leads would have turned out damn nearly identically.  |
|  Men are biologically different  |  Most of these stories have magitek or actual magic. What the fuck does biological difference matter at that point?  |
|  ... but this story has no magic  |  Most men also don't keep physically fit enough to actually win a fight against a trained woman.  |
|  Disrespect of culture / history  |  When the story is driven by a magic-empowered Knights Templar Order, who the fuck cares about complete historical or cultural accuracy? Just don't be a bigot to other cultures, that's it.  |
|  Character too ugly / unrelatable  |  Always funny when the critique is that media is too realistic. Never seen ugly / fat / unrelatable people in real life before, such as the person in the mirror?  |
