#   Daily Notes

A dumping ground of one note a day.
Notes will probably not make much sense.
Any organisation in this is purely coincidence.
The notes are actually more of an excuse to either test feature implementation or push commits.

##  Updating

Not confined to a once-a-day update.
That'd be stupid because there will be errors to fix and last minute thoughts to include (or remove).
(Not that "remove" actually exists on GitHub, other than "remove bugs"...)
