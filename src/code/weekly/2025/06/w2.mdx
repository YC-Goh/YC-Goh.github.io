    No, it's not standard romance.
    I don't read standard romance shit.\
    But apparently the ending is a bit of a downer.
    Not in the "makes you cry" sense, but in the "why the hell did the author do this" sense.

##  Side Thoughts

### Men trend right-wing and unsurprisingly blame liberals and feminists for that

[This entire thread is flaming garbage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l609np/stop_coddling_these_people/)

####    Why?

Take a step back and notice all of these.
Complete garbage.

-   In-Group vs Out-Group:
    -   In-Group:
        -   See? Cats are good animals!
        -   No! That bad cat is just a bad apple!
    -   Out-Group:
        -   Wow, what a good dog!
        -   See? All dogs are violent monsters!
-   Premature generalisation:
    -   Really funny (not) since nobody misunderstands this in (Social Sciences) academia:
        -   "Women earn less than men" typically just means "women learn less than men _on average_".
    -   Maybe more of a strawman fallacy: 
        adversarial opponents _purposely_ read the argument to conveniently appear absurd.
-   Hypocrisy:
    -   You must treat me personally,
        but I will treat all of you the same.
    -   For the willfully blind:
        In too many places, it's still the norm that men harass and proposition women.
        Why should anyone expect any women then to treat any random stranger men as anything other than creeps?
        Based on vibes? ChatGPT hallucinations?
    -   If you think your society is exceptional, bloody think again.
        -   Are men who have a lot of sex celebrated as "manly"?
        -   Are women who have a lot of sex derided as "sluts"?
-   "But I'm different":
    -   In the absence of data, anyone can claim anything, 
        including that their godfather is Tun Abdul Razak and their grandmother really owns the street.
-   Fallacy of composition:
    -   Yesterday some random cats online said dogs should meow more 
        but then today some other random cats laughed at me for meowing.
        What do cats want?
    -   Also:
        Possibly False Attribution and Taking Arguments Out of Context.
        Any ass can claim that a bunch of mean girls bullied them yesterday.
        Well... did that really happen?
        Are these asses really telling all?
        Do they dare to show all their sources if they claim they read it all online?
-   Onus of Responsibility not guided by any Moral Philosophy:
    -   Why should dogs make cats feel welcome before cats stop scratching dogs' faces on sight?
    -   Basically rhetorical question, because the answer is very clear.
        -   Power.
            Mostly socio-political, but also physical / violent.
        -   Akerlof's caveat: Almost nobody thinks like this
            but society behaves consistently with this rationalisation:
            -   Men have the _political power_ to make womens' lives very miserable.
            -   Hence, women who don't want a bad time _better make men feel safe, welcome, and loved_.
    -   Argument to the Stick: Make men feel loved. _Or else_.

##  Other Stuff

-   Didn't happen.
    Might still not happen for a while.
