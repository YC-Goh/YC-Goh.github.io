    Cute premise. Not standard romance.\
    Apparently the ending is a downer, in the "why the hell did the author do this" sense.

##  Random Thoughts

### Men trend right-wing and unsurprisingly blame liberals and feminists

[Flaming garbage thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l609np/stop_coddling_these_people/)

####    Take a step back

-   In-Group vs Out-Group:
    -   In-Group:
        -   See? Cats are good animals!
        -   No! That bad cat is just a bad apple!
    -   Out-Group:
        -   Wow, what a good dog!
        -   See? All dogs are violent monsters!
-   Overgeneralisation:
    -   Somehow nobody misunderstands this in (Social Sciences) academia:
        -   "Women earn less than men" typically just means "women learn less than men _on average_".
    -   Maybe more of a strawman fallacy: 
        these statements are being _purposely_ misread to conveniently appear absurd.
-   Hypocrisy:
    -   I demand personal treatment but offer none to your group.
    -   For the blind:
        In most places, it is still the norm that men harass and proposition women.
        Why would any woman be expected to treat random men as anything other than creeps?
    -   No society is exceptional. Think again.
        -   Are sexually-active men celebrated as "manly"?
        -   Are sexually-active women insulted as "sluts"?
-   "But I'm different":
    -   In the absence of data, anyone can claim anything, 
        including that their godfather is Tun Abdul Razak and their grandmother really owns the street.
-   Fallacy of composition:
    -   Yesterday some cats said dogs should meow more. 
        Today some other cats laughed at me for meowing.
        What do cats want?
    -   Also:
        Possibly False Attribution and Taking Arguments Out of Context.
        -   Any ass can claim that a bunch of mean girls bullied them yesterday.
            Did that really happen?
        -   Do they dare to show their sources if they claim they read it all online?
-   Onus of Responsibility not guided by any Moral Philosophy:
    -   Why should dogs make cats feel welcome before cats stop scratching dogs' faces on sight?
    -   Basically rhetorical question. Answer:
        -   Power. Argumentum ad Baculum.
        -   Akerlof's caveat: 
            Societal behaviour is _consistent_ with this rationalisation:
            -   _Men have the power_ to make womens' lives very miserable.
            -   Hence, women who don't want a bad time _better make men feel safe, welcome, and loved_.
