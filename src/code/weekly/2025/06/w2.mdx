##  Shitty Thoughts

[This entire thread is flaming garbage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1l609np/stop_coddling_these_people/)

Why?
Every single one of the following informal fallacies are in action.
Pure f-ing piss.
If not for the fact that women and LGBTQ+ people will suffer as a result,
I would say let straight men wallow in their own shit and just despair in darkness forever.

-   In-Group vs Out-Group:
    -   In-Group:
        -   See? Cats are good animals!
        -   No! That bad cat does not represent all of us!
    -   Out-Group:
        -   Wow, what a good dog!
        -   See? All dogs are violent monsters just waiting for the chance to attack us!
-   Premature generalisation:
    -   Really f-ing funny since nobody misunderstands this in (Social Sciences) academia:
        -   "Women earn less than men" typically just means "women learn less than men _on average_".
    -   I actually think this is more of a strawman fallacy: 
        adversarial opponents _purposely_ read the argument to conveniently appear absurd and therefore weak.
-   Hypocrisy:
    -   I am different and you must see me for who I am.
        But if any one of you make me sad, then all of you need to change your behaviour.
    -   For f-gs who don't get it, just understand this point:
        In places where catcalling, propositioning, and sexual harassment are so normalised that most girls experience it before coming of age,
        why the flying f- would anyone expect women to treat any men they don't know in any personal capacity differently from a generalised creep?
        Based on vibes? ChatGPT visions?
-   "But I'm different":
    -   In the absence of data, any f-wit can claim anything, 
        including that their godfather is Tun Abdul Razak and their grandmother really owns the street.
-   Fallacy of composition:
    -   Yesterday some random cats online said dogs should meow more 
        but then today some other random cats laughed at me for meowing.
        What do cats want?
    -   Also:
        Possibly False Attribution and Taking Arguments Out of Context.
        Any ass can claim that a bunch of mean girls bullied them yesterday.
        Well... did that really happen?
        Are these asses really telling all?
        Do they dare to show all their sources if they claim they read it all online?
-   Onus of responsibility not guided by any Moral Philosophy:
    -   Why should dogs make cats feel welcome before cats stop scratching dogs' faces on sight?
    -   By the way this question is about 99.9% rhetorical, because the answer is disgustingly simple.
        -   Power.
            Mostly socio-political, but sometimes also physical / violent.
        -   Following Akerlof's wonderful caveat, let's just say that generally nobody actually thinks like this,
            but most people act like this is precisely how they rationally decide their actions:
            -   Men have the political power to make womens' lives _very_ miserable.
            -   So if women want to have a good time, _they better make sure that men feel safe, welcome, and loved_.
    -   A different take would say this is an Argument to the Stick fallacy: Make men feel loved. _Or else_.
