### The Long Peace is Over

I want to organise my thoughts, 
but it's impossible to organise because it's too many
and most of these are pushing me to give up on this world.

####    Many related thoughts in no particular order:

1.  The 2025 Israel-Iran War and Israel's almost-assured victory with US and global public opinion backing
    will irreversibly clear the way for "pre-emptive self-defence" to return as a legitimate moral reason for Just War.
    -   A lot of people just _don't get_ how low this lowers the bar for pretexts for war.
2.  Nuclear non-proliferation is dead.
    Permanently.
    -   Russia dared to strike Ukraine because it knew it's nuclear shield prevented peer powers from intervening conclusively in Ukraine's favour.
    -   Israel dared to strike Iran because it had a lot of intelligence from Iran submitting itself to IAEA inspection regimes in the past 
        and the backing of US intelligence, 
        and Iran had not yet completed its nuclear programme and hence had no credible deterrence.
    -   Side note: Israel always talks up Iran as an existential threat
        but Iran has to play games with Hamas and Hezbollah because the truth is the reverse.
    -   Conversely, nobody dares to touch North Korea because it has a credible nuclear shield.
        Ironically, with America fast losing credibility as a security guarantor,
        South Korea is now under credible military threat from North Korea without its own nuclear shield.
3.  America is absolutely now an authoritarian state and no longer is a credible security guarantee for its "allies".
    Pax Americana is over.
    -   An electorate that elected Trump twice will absolutely elect another authoritarian,
        given another chance at free and fair elections.
    -   America has essentially abandoned NATO.
        The formal structures of the alliance remain,
        but nobody should hope for events to test whether these structures have any foundation.
    -   America's pivot to the Pacific is not based on any visible grand strategy of building alliances to wall in China.
        Instead it looks more like Colonial Era Great Power games,
        where local states were just pawns to be subjugated, abused, and traded, not agents to be treated with any respect.
4.  China continually tests and contests air, sea, and border control of _all_ states in its Sphere of Influence.
    -   Theory of Revealed Preference.
        This is _not_ how a power intent on being a peaceful partner behaves.
5.  India is not any better.
    -   I already consider India neither liberal nor democratic,
        but most will disagree because the _formal_ structures of liberal democracy remain.
    -   Also many will have a vested interest a positive narrative about India
        because absent a grand alliance between Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, and Japan,
        there just isn't any other credible counterweight to China in Asia.

### Why does any of this matter?

Anecdotal social media posts, 
but actual voting patterns around the world indicate that these are _widespread_ and _real_ public opinoins:
-   [Does anyone else not care about politics and international affairs?](https://old.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/18f31xl/does_anyone_else_not_care_about_politics_and)
-   [Why do non-Americans care so much about American politics?](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1c0m386/why_do_nonamericans_care_so_much_about_american)
-   [What does the U.S. actually gain from intervening around the world?](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/19bx7p2/what_does_the_us_actually_gain_from_intervening)

####    So, why?

1.  There is no such thing as true isolationism, 
    as in the na&iuml;ve view that the country can just shut its borders, look inward,
    and pretend the rest of the world does not exist.
    -   Isolationism is in fact quite an _active_ foreign policy option. 
    -   The policy is to _deter_, _prevent_, and _resist_ all foreign engagements, and _avoid_ foreign influence.
2.  Countries have tried isolationalism.
    To a point, basically all of them _failed_ in the principal goal
    of avoiding foreign and geopolitical entanglement.
    -   Japan: Perry Expedition.
    -   China: Century of Humiliation.
    -   USA: Pearl Harbour.
3.  Who benefits from a more isolationist world
    where powers retreat to their Spheres of Influence and co-exist only on a truce basis?
    -   Isolationism is _not realistic policy_ for regional and smaller powers.
        This means cutting off potential allies and markets.
    -   Economic integration with diplomatic isolationism is fantastic rubbish
        without power or alliances.
    -   Neutrality is a misnomer.
        Neutral powers are effectively _everyone's bitch_.
    -   Neutrality, like vote spoiling and non-voting, is also an _active_ stance:
        it means to be perfectly fine with whoever the reigning power(s) is / are,
        no matter their values, violence, or tyranny.
        -   If this makes no sense, consider how you would interpret a country in Europe or East / South-East Asia remaining neutral in WWII.
        -   "It's not my fight, why should _I_ care?" Well, great, until _they_ set their sights on _you_ as well.
    -   States with power _will always intervene to their advantage_ than remain neutral.
4.  Modern prosperity and quality of life is...
    absolutely not the product of isolationism.
