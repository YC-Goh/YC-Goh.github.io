    The ending seals the package.
    But for about two-thirds of the story it is important to remember that both MCs basically are mentally ill and grew up in broken homes.

##  Random Thoughts

### The Long Peace is Over

####    In no particular order:

1.  2025 Israel-Iran War.
    -   Israel's war to lose.
    -   Global and US public opinion backing is practically assured. 
    -   "Pre-emptive self-defence" as moral pretext for Just War will be irreversibly normalised.
    -   A lot of idiots _do not_ comprehend how low this lowers the bar for war.
2.  Nuclear non-proliferation is dead.
    -   Russo-Ukrainian War:
        Ukrainian efforts to obtain foreign aid and weapons purchases is crippled by the West's fear of Russia's nuclear shield. 
    -   Israel-Iran War:
        Israel dared to strike because it knew Iran _did not have a nuclear shield_,
        hence there was no credible deterrent or retaliation.
        -   Note: 
            Israel claims Iran is an existential threat.
            Nothing is an existential threat to the empire that has America as its client state.
    -   Korean Armistice:
        South Korea has historically never retaliated against North Korea's salami slicing tactics _because of_ the nuclear shield.
        -   With declining American credibility as a security guarantor,
            South Korea has to now consider building its own second-strike capability to forestall the inevitable restart of war.
3.  Pax Americana is over.
    -   America is now irreversibly an authoritarian state.
        -   An electorate that elected Trump twice will absolutely elect another authoritarian.
    -   America has essentially abandoned NATO.
        -   The _formal_ structures remain but best not test whether those structures have foundations.
    -   America's pivot to the Pacific has no visible grand alliance strategy.
        -   Instead it looks like Colonial Era Great Power games.
        -   No longer clear if American protection is any better than Chinese dominance.
4.  China continually tests and contests air, sea, and border control of all states in its Sphere of Influence.
    -   Theory of Revealed Preference:
        This is _not_ how a peaceful great power behaves.
5.  India is also a shithole.
    -   I consider India neither liberal nor democratic despite the _formal_ structures of liberal democracy.
    -   Positive narratives of India are pushed because there are no other credible counterweights to China in Asia.

### Who Cares?

Voting patterns the world over indicate that these view are _widespread_:
-   [Does anyone else not care about politics and international affairs?](https://old.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/18f31xl/does_anyone_else_not_care_about_politics_and)
-   [Why do non-Americans care so much about American politics?](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1c0m386/why_do_nonamericans_care_so_much_about_american)
-   [What does the U.S. actually gain from intervening around the world?](https://old.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/19bx7p2/what_does_the_us_actually_gain_from_intervening)

####    So?

The ordinary electorate should care.

1.  There is no such thing as true isolationism in the na&iuml;ve layman sense.
    -   The only truly isolationist thing that isolationist America did was to do nothing about WWII until Pearl Harbor.
2.  Countries have tried isolationalism and most _failed_.
    -   Japan: Perry Expedition.
    -   China: Century of Humiliation.
    -   USA: Pearl Harbour.
3.  Who benefits from an isolationist world?
    -   Isolationism for weaker states just means cutting off allies and markets.
    -   Economic integration with non-interventionism is high fantasy without power.
    -   Neutrality means the weak state is _everyone's bitch_.
        -   Neutrality means to be fine with any reigning power no matter their values or tyranny.
        -   Neutrality means to be fine with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan doing things around you and using you as a staging post in WWII.
        -   "It's not _my_ fight, why should _I_ care?" is great until "and then they came for me".
    -   Truly powerful states _never_ choose isolationism when they can interfere to their benefit.
4.  Individually, what happens half a world away can still screw _you_ over.
    -   Modern prosperity and quality of life is fully rooted in international trade and global supply chains.
    -   Many countries have a vested interest in restricting consumption in _other_ countries:
        1.  China would erase Tiananmen Square from global history if it could.
        2.  US and Russia would erase LGBTQ+ media globally if they could.
        3.  China and US both would lock in client states to their advanced technology ecosystem if they could,
            to maintain total control over client states.
    -   Stable supply of popular foreign goods is highly dependent on states not being dipshits.
        1.  As realistic as pigs flying in the 21st century.
        1.  K-Pop: 
            Only protected by the Korean Armistice.
        2.  Anime Games, Media and Manga: 
            For some genres, only protected by China not feeling confident enough to sanction or embargo Japan for exporting or publishing those genres.
        3.  Tourism:
            Try holidaying when cities are reduced to rubble, countries are at war,
            or when there is no guarantee of safe, uninterrupted flights.
    -   Some countries do not have true food and water security:
        1.  Food supply: adequate without trade?
        2.  Water supply: is the origin of supply within the state's own borders?
