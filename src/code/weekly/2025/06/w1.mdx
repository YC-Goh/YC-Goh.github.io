#   Incredibly F-ed Week

##  Interesting Read

-   [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)\
    Title drop on first chapter.
    MC1 is a cute disaster.
    MC2 is not much better.\
    *Do not* read before going to work.

##  Side Thoughts

-   'tis the month when some people start screaming again about games and media being "political".
    Also depending on the franchise and setting, also "unrealistic" or "not historical".
    -   But fiction is fiction because it's fiction.
        Being unrealistic and not exactly true to history is the point most of the time.
    -   Ignoring the fact that "political" is a dog whistle,
        it's just interesting for fiction and media to actually explore things.
    -   One's "non-political" is someone else's "political" and "hate speech".

##  Other Stuff

-   Not gonna happen this week after spending hours getting the navigation list online.
    Thank the usual culprits (this country is better known for work-work balance).
