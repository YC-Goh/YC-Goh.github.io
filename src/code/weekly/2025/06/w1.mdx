#   Incredibly F-ed Week

##  Fun Reads

-   [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)\
    Title drop on first chapter.
    MC1 is a cute disaster.
    MC2 is only slightly better, but by word of god she's very competent at work.\
    *Do not* read before going to work.

##  Side Thoughts

-   Especially this month, but on the regular some people scream on and on about games and media being "political".
    Also depending on the franchise and setting, also "woke", "unrealistic", or "not historical".
    -   [Example](https://old.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1l4u05k/someone_said_that_they_hope_that_the_final/)
    -   But fiction is fiction because it's fiction.
        Being unrealistic, possibly very fantastic, and not completely true to history is the point most of the time.
    -   Ignoring the fact that "political" is a dog whistle,
        it's just interesting for fiction and media to actually explore things.
    -   One's "non-political" is someone else's "political" and "hate speech".
    -   Also, who cares?
        If I want to see nothing but depressing realism, I'll just go walk around outside or borrow from the history section of the library.
-   [This discussion](https://old.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1l5a2ln/former_doge_engineer_says_federal_waste_and_fraud/)
    will never not be funny to me.
    -   [Actual article](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/02/nx-s1-5417994/former-doge-engineer-shares-his-experience-working-for-the-cost-cutting-unit)
    -   "Fraud and waste" is again another dog whistle.
        Too many otherwise-smart people don't realise this for sanity's sake.
    -   Another way to think about this:
        "Fraud" is when the "undeserving" get money and "waste" is when money is given to the "undeserving".
        Now, define "undeserving".
-   The political right is incredibly adept at [fronting legitimate issues](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4zpnl2x3eo) to 
    [push other agendas](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/04/03/trump-attacking-universities-funding-us-politics/).
    -   Politcal centrists are typically either incredibly gullible, buying the fronted reason wholesale,
        or incredibly unimaginative and unable to imagine that the future could be anything other than status quo.
    -   The political left is incredibly na&iuml;ve, typically expecting everyone to "get it",
        so they just start screaming on and on about needing to resist the right's policies and actions.
        But because most people _actually don't "get it"_, all it starts looking like is that the left "supports the enemy".
    -   Also anyway even when the political left does bother to explain, barely anyone listens.
-   Along the way trying to pull the sources I've been reading, is this 
    [amazingly na&iuml;ve view](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-attack-on-harvard-marks-new-phase-in-the-culture-war.html)
    embedded in the NY Magazine Intelligencer section.
    -   I think this is a good reminder to self why I don't peruse this garbage other than when wasting time on public transport anymore.
    -   I don't know a better way to explain what's wrong with this view other than this:
        According to this author's view, political rightwingers will not be censoring liberal and left-wing views today
        if the political left did not censor them in the past.
    -   Probably a lot of people won't get it, but it's a bit like the victim-blaming argument for rape:
        The rapist would not have raped the victim if the victim did not entice the rapist by their dressing.
    -   Which is incredibly stupid because rapists rape (and criminals crime) simply because they can and they want to,
        laws be damned, and not because the victim enticed them into doing so for some god-forsaken reason.

##  Other Stuff

-   Not gonna happen this week after spending hours getting the navigation list online.
    Thank the usual culprits (this country is better known for work-work balance).
