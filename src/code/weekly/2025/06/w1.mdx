    Title drop on first chapter.
    MC1 is a cute disaster.
    MC2 is also a disaster, in a different way. At least, she is competent at work.\
    *Do not* read before going to work.

##  Random Thoughts

### Homogeneity in media is retarded and boring

-   What's wrong with games and media being "political", "woke", or "unrealistic"?
    -   [Example](https://old.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1l4u05k/someone_said_that_they_hope_that_the_final/)
        of peak retard.
    -   Fiction is fiction because it's fiction.
        It should explore lots of topics.
    -   "Political" is a dog whistle.
        In fact, I think forcing heteronormativity into every piece of media is political tyranny.
    -   Also, who cares?
        B oring realism is available just outside my windows.
        I don't need games or media for that.

### Too little people understand how Right-Wing politics works

    ([article](https://www.npr.org/2025/06/02/nx-s1-5417994/former-doge-engineer-shares-his-experience-working-for-the-cost-cutting-unit))
    will never not be funny to me.
    -   "Fraud and waste" is a dog whistle:
        "Fraud" is when the "undeserving" get money and "waste" is when money is given to the "undeserving".
        Define "undeserving".
-   The political right is incredibly adept at [fronting legitimate issues](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4zpnl2x3eo) to 
    [push other agendas](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/04/03/trump-attacking-universities-funding-us-politics/).
    -   Politcal centrists are incredibly gullible:
        They either buy the fronted reason
        or cannot imagine any future other than status quo.
    -   The political left is incredibly na&iuml;ve:
        They think everyone "gets it" and just screams about "resisting".
        But because most people actually _don't "get it"_, it just looks like the left "supports the enemy".
    -   Even when the political left does try explaining, nobody listens.
-   Found while finding my sources is this 
    [na&iuml;ve view](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-attack-on-harvard-marks-new-phase-in-the-culture-war.html)
    in NYMag.
    -   According to this author, political right censorship is the fault of the political left
        because the political left censored them first.
    -   Extremely na&iuml;ve worldview that needs all of the following to be true:
        1.  All parties are rational actors in an infinite-horizon cooperation game playing tit-for-tat
            (i.e., they "cooperate" in good faith and only "defects" when the other party "defects" first).
        2.  The political right has never "defected" before,
            hence the political left's "defection" is an inexplicable norm violation.
        3.  The political left has no valid reason to "defect", but "defected" anyway.
            Hence they "deserve" to be "punished".
