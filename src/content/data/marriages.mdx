#   Marriage Patterns

##  Descriptives

### Pre-Caveats

This is Singapore open data ([data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg)).
Bride and groom are synonymous with female and male.

Same-sex marriages / unions are not legally recognised in Singapore yet.
In any case, given how this data is likely collected and stored,
even in the event of legalisation it will be a while before high quality data is publicly available.

### Marriages By Education Level

####    Figure 1

Proportions all marriages annually, 
by the education level of each party.
Within each year, the sum of all proportions should be 1.0 (i.e., 100%).

####    Positive Assortative Mating

Same-education level marriages are much more common than expected.
This is consistent over time.

Note that the expected marriage proportions are simply based on the assumption of independence
applied to observed marginal distributions of marriages.
These are also fairly similar between all marriages and first marriages.

### Marriages By Age Group

####    Figure 2

Proportions all marriages annually, 
by the age group of each party.

![Observed vs Expected Marriage Breakdown by Age Groups](/marriage_divorce_birth/marriage_agegrp_all.svg)

####    Positive Assortative Mating

Similar-age marriages up to groom older by about 5 years are more common than expected.
This is consistent over time.

Unlike with education level, no upward trend for age 40+ marriages is observed among first marriages.
Older marriages is driven primarily by remarriages, intuitively.

There is some implication that either the divorce rate has been rising, leading to more chances for older people to remarry,
or there was some stigma against remarriage that has eroded over time.

### Divorces By Age Group

####    Figure 3

Proportions all divorces annually, 
by the age group of each party.

####    Late Divorces

The high proportion of divorces among older residents essentially mechanically explains the upward trend in remarriage among older residents.

Note, this does not imply that marriages among older residents are unstable
because it could also mean that longer-lasting marriages are not necessarily safe from dissolution.

Also note, these plots show the proportional breakdown of divorces,
not absolute number of divorces.
Late divorces constitute an increasingly really high proportion of dissolutions
despite comprising a relatively small number of new unions (and especially new first unions),
which does have the implication that many younger marriages in earlier times are not as stable as imagined.

### Divorces by Age Group at Marriage

####    Figure 4

Proportions all divorces annually, 
by the age group at marriage of each party.

####    Early Marriages being Dissolved

This appears to corroborate the story above.
While there is some upward trend in proportion of divorces involving marriages at older ages, 
most divorces still involve couples who are under 40 at the point of marriage.

The decline in proportion of divorces involving couples under 25 at the point of marriage
appears to be almost entirely attributable to the decline in proportion of marriages involving couples under 25 in general.
However, the affirmative story is impossible to tell without also knowing the year of marriage.

### Divorces by Age Group and Marriage Duration at Divorce

####    Figure 5

Proportions divorces for each gender, by age group and duration of marriage at divorce.

####    Marriages Earlier in Life at Risk of Dissolution

Going by the marriage duration and age at divorce, 
it appears that generally it is marriages done between ages 20-34 that get dissolved.
While age groups above 40 have been aggregated down to 40+, 
most of the divorces happen between 40-49
with durations suggesting most of these marriages were done between ages 25-39.

### Marital Statuses by Gender and Cohort

####    Figure 6

for latest 9 non-overlapping 10-year birth cohorts.

####    Stability in Singlehood Rate after 40

Consistent with trends above, the singlehood rate stabilises at around age 40,
while the still-married rate begins declining after 40, with gentler declines for more recent generations.

Because released statistics do not differentiate between married and remarried,
it is difficult to tell how much of the marriage rate stability is due to fast remarriage among older cohorts.

On the other hand, concurrent with the decline in widowhood rate, 
the currently-divorced rate is on a upward over cohorts.

### Marital Statuses by Gender and Age Group

####    Figure 7

Marital status at each age group over cohort birth years.

![Marital Status at each Age Group over Cohort Birth Years](/marriage_divorce_birth/maritalstatus_agegrp_all.svg)

####    Alternative Perspective of the Same Data

This view offers basically the same story, which is the decline in currently-married rates 
and increase in still-single and currently-divorced rates in more recent cohorts.

The sole exception is the increase in still-married rates of older cohorts in their old age for females,
due quite certainly almost entirely to the decline in transition to widowhood 
(as well as likely higher rates of remarriage).

### Marital Rates by Gender and Age Group

####    Figure 8

Marriage rates at each age group over cohort birth years.

![Marital Rates at each Age Group over Cohort Birth Years](/marriage_divorce_birth/marriage_rate_all.svg)

####    Essentially Same Story as Marriages by Age Group

Marriage is being delayed, particularly among females.
However, most who are able and willing to get married eventually still get married.

### Marriages by Age Group and Education

####    Figure 9

Marriage breakdown at each age group by education level over cohort birth years.

####    Overwhelming Majority of University Marriages Occur Early

University graduates overwhelmingly marry university graduates,
so we can be certain that the last panel represents mostly marriages between university graduates.

Female university graduates overwhelmingly marry before 30 even in recent cohorts
while males are trending toward marring between 25 to 34.

This appears not to be unique to university graduates.
The only difference is that female graduates at education levels lower than university
historically married even younger, essentially just about when they reached adulthood (20-29).

Hence age trends appears not to be a composition issue with increasing education.
Marriage is simply occurring later regardless of education levels.
This suggests positive assortative mating by education levels is driven by a tangential mechanism
to the increase in age of marriage.
