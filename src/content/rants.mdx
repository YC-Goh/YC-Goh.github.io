|  \{w-1/4\}Topic  |  Brief  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  Misogyny  |  Faggots really come up with a million and twenty-three excuses to justify voting against womens' rights (and LGBTQ) rights instead of fixing their own behaviour.  |
|  The (American) Political Left  |  Won't be surprised if this faction is actually a Russian plant because they are incomprehensibly shit at building power structures and political coalitions.  |
|  "Realism" in Media  |  Just another dog whistle for being anti- anything that is not straight, White / East Asian, conventionally attractive male / female in media.  |
|  Long Peace  |  Will never understand why idiots around the world think peace is weak and boring.  |
