|  [How many PhDs does the world need? Doctoral graduates vastly outnumber jobs in academia](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01855-w)  |  Well... in tech bro utopia, graduates will outnumber jobs regardless of education level or sector...  |

|  ['Harm' must not be redefined by US conservation agencies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01921-3)  |  Pity the scientist that still has hope for conservation science in the USA.  |

|  [In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01966-4)  |  In a different time, in a different place, pigs do fly and public transport is powered by unicorns.  |
|  [The Covid 'lab leak' theory isn't just a rightwing conspiracy - pretending that's the case is bad for science](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/25/covid-lab-leak-theory-right-conspiracy-science)  |  Broadly, this is why the answer to the paradox of tolerance is to accept censorship of intolerance.  |

But RFK, Jr., Isn't Pursuing Them](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-actions-could-make-vaccines-safer-but-rfk-jr-isnt-pursuing-them)  |  The most common format of popular science reporting, which is giving your opponents equal voice no matter how justified by the total weight of evidence, does itself plainly no favours. Well, the USA deserves precisely zero public health policy anyway. Just don't export this regarded fuckshit.  |

|  [Climate misinformation turning crisis into catastrophe, report says](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/19/climate-misinformation-turning-crisis-into-catastrophe-ipie-report)  |  Funny. Is this problem worth fixing anymore, anyway?  |
