##  EU Politics

|  [Italy citizenship referendum: 'I was born here - but feel rejected'](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c780yk3z2lyo)  |  Times when such reforms had a realistic chance in hell to pass are long over.  |
|  [The 'sacrifice zone': villagers resist the EU's green push for lithium mining](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/21/lithium-mining-sacrifice-zone-portuguese-villagers-eu-energy-transition)  |  Too bad, this did not need to happen if the world didn't get spooked by weaponised global supply chains.  |

##  UK Politics

|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Britain has escalated the global nuclear arms race](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/08/uk-strategic-defence-review-nuclear-arms-race-armageddon)  |  The political left keeps pining for long-lost battles instead of fighting the current war.  |
|  [PM defends leadership amid growing welfare rebellion](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr792ej27y3o)  |  Yeah this entire thing can be a rant post of it's own. Labour leadership doing the "right" thing given the UK political landscape today but they will not be rewarded for it.  |

##  EU Foreign Policy

|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [The World Needs a Stronger NATO](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/world-needs-stronger-nato)  |  Title does not match narrative. Also the spending target is such a cynical ploy to kill EU welfare states and force spending on the US defence sector.  |
|  [EU bars Chinese firms from major state medical equipment contracts](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/eu-bars-china-firms-major-state-medical-equipment-contracts-5193851)  |  The protectionism he-said-she-said is likely the biggest red herring in this article.  |
|  [NATO summit spending promises may cost America dear](https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2025-06/nato-summit-spending-promises-may-cost-america-dear)  |  So happy that an actual prof is saying these things so I don't feel like I'm going crazy.  |
|  [Europe Is Irrelevant to the New Middle East](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/25/europe-irrelevant-middle-east-trump-iran-israel-war)  |  Well the EU can fuck itself too. Dipshits there especially the big 3 states basically endorsed "might is right" diplomacy.  |
|  [Stockholm Syndrome in The Hague](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/06/25/nato-summit-the-hague-europe-us-trump)  |  Europe loves dicktators a lot more than they claim.  |
|  [Beware the Europe You Wish For](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/europe/beware-europe-you-wish-wallander)  |  Europe is welcome to say no to the People's Republic of America when Supreme Leader offers them the Perry Expedition treatment.  |
|  [Zelensky and Council of Europe rights body sign accord for Ukraine war tribunal](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20250625-zelensky-council-of-europe-rights-body-sign-accord-ukraine-war-tribunal-russia)  |  Good luck to Europe on this. Late-20th-century International Law is quite dead at this point.  |

|  [Note to Starmer and the other sabre-rattlers. Why spend billions on weapons - soft power would keep us safe](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/26/starmer-billions-weapons-soft-power-keep-united-kingdom-safe)  |  This is the exact position I'd expect a Russian intelligence asset infiltrating the political left to advocate.  |
|  [Lotus considering shifting UK production to US](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr3gn3lv8zo)  |  If this becomes a trend, it will absolutely kill the 20th-century international trade order. Pure begger-thy-neighbour horsecrap that shitholes engage in instead of building shared prosperity.  |
