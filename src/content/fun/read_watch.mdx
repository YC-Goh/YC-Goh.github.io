#   Fun Things to Get Through the Week

##  Read

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. Cute read, relatively minimal drama. The main couple are both cute disasters.  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Some psychological drama, but quite sweet ending given what the set-up is. The psychological stuff comes from both MCs growing up in broken families.  |
|  [Revenge of the Fallen Angel Soprano](https://comic-walker.com/detail/KC_006778_S/episodes/KC_0067780000200011_E)  |  No actual angels or anything supernatural. Despite the title and how Ch. 1 goes, the pacing appears to be moving in a largely wholesome and fluffy direction.  |
|  [As the Yuri Goddess Commands](https://storia.takeshobo.co.jp/manga/yurigamisama/)  |  What would have been a morbid start gets played for laughs. Which I guess is a good sign that this will likely be a mostly light and cute story, with some shenanigans that may or may not basically be the author's self-insert.  |
|  ["I Wanna Touch You", then Love Begins](https://storia.takeshobo.co.jp/manga/furekoi/)  |  Mild drama with some borderline aromantic representation. Otherwise super fluffy.  |
|  [Gal Maid & VIllianess!](https://ichijin-plus.com/comics/140594018976160)  |  Would have been my absolute favourite take on villianess GL if capitalism didn't axe it early. It should have been 30 chapters minimum with the main confession between ch. 18-24. Taking the setting seriously absolutely required a slow-burn romance.  |
|  [Girlfriend Limited to 7 Days](https://comic-walker.com/detail/KC_005863_S/episodes/KC_0058630001400011_E)  |  Trial relationship to real thing, but GL and one side has issues she has never fully resolved. A setting obviously ripe for drama. However this author seemingly loves her happy endings, so hang on tight.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on villianess reincarnation GL so far, even moreso than I'm in Love with the Villianess. Also fairly interesting that PBMMV and ILTV share similar plot driving ideas in later acts.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Intern!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32305)  |  Note: Real EN title is "My Intern Bullied Me Again!" This was a really funny find because I found it back-to-back with PBMMV due to looking at the bullying tag. Prepare for second-hand embarassment... from the boss.  |
|  [Childhood Sweetheart Liaoliao](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32084)  |  Really sweet read, basically no drama, and super funny find in hindsight. This makes 3 popular GLs where the MC gets together with their (division director level!) boss.  |
|  [Night Owls & Summer Skies](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/night-owls-and-summer-skies/list?title_no=4747)  |  The main couple makes the read worthwhile, but ending is left to your imagination. YMMV on the use of the misunderstood bully trope since it is mostly a myth that functions as apologia for bullies in real life.  |
|  [Winter Before Spring](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/winter-before-spring/list?title_no=6400)  |  Read the blurb, then mull over the title. Despite knowing this, Act 1 will still be very, very painful and heartbreaking. How do people even read stories like The Summer You Were Here without dying of heartbreak?  |
|  [What are the Chances](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/what-are-the-chances/list?title_no=480113)  |  Fun read with some reincarnation shenanigans. YMMV warning: the main couple has an Age Gap (but no minors). (That said, why are people not OK with Age Gap but OK with Status Gap simultaneously!? Status Gaps are equally problematic if the superior is male!)  |
|  [Make Her Mine](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/make-her-mine/list?title_no=916067)  |  This makes me sad because I'm Team Childhood Friend but most commenters are Team New Girl -- and the blurb strongly hints that NG will win. Problem is, everything goes wrong for CF while everything goes right for NG. CF deserves a happy ending and I just want to know what it is.  |
|  [Dallae](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/dallae/list?title_no=8368)  |  Really short story. A slight bit of drama and some fantasy, but the story really only cares about the main couple.  |
|  [Yellow](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/yellow/list?title_no=840112)  |  Imagine dating your favourite streamer and they are as wholesome IRL as on-screen. Pure sugar. No drama.  |
|  [Mage & Demon Queen](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/mage-and-demon-queen/list?title_no=1438)  |  Basically the original GL flagbearer on the site and to some extent, the EN-original community. Not sure why the ending includes Science Babies, but oh well.  |

##  Watch

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Chaser Game Double](https://www.gagaoolala.com/en/videos/3992/chaser-game-w-2024-s01e01)  |  Quite famously a GL spin-off of regular office romance drama Chaser Game. Readers of the manga adaptation find it toxic, but I find it compelling and worthy of the "Drama" tag. YMMV. And do not actually copy these behaviours IRL, please.  |
|  [Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko](https://www.gagaoolala.com/en/videos/4521/ayaka-is-in-love-with-hiroko-2024-s01e01)  |  Another office romance drama. Again, another one where manga readers (this is manga-original BTW) found it toxic. YMMV and again do not copy the less-admirable behaviours IRL, please, for obvious reasons.  |
|  [Hina Logic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl12grj-StM5rf3UOWjX_ZCg)  |  GL spin-off of what was otherwise just a promo anime for a TCG. Magical Girl concept like Nanoha, but more fluffy and more explicit with the GL, especially toward the end.  |
|  [The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhGamQZtJ7K8O7i0ypG3qsLtqViTmmjot)  |  First GL Harem I am aware of to be animated in the current era. Unfortunately the YT global release of HikiKomari is time and region locked.  |
|  [There's No Freaking Way I'll be Your Lover! Unless...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhGamQZtJ7K8yocPHbrtrYmX8NdN6hvOW)  |  THE GL Harem flagbearer of this era with this level of quality release, even though HikiKomari was first to get animated and is actually faithful to the source material. A lot of hopes and dreams are now riding on Watanare to break a major Yuri genre glass ceiling by greenlighting S2 covering LN volumes 5-8.  |
