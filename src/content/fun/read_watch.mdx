#   Fun Things to Get Through the Week

##  Read

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. Cute read, relatively minimal drama. The main couple are both cute disasters.  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Some psychological drama, but quite sweet ending given what the set-up is. The psychological stuff comes from both MCs growing up in broken families.  |
|  [Revenge of the Fallen Angel Soprano](https://comic-walker.com/detail/KC_006778_S/episodes/KC_0067780000200011_E)  |  No actual angels or anything supernatural. Despite the title and how Ch. 1 goes, the pacing appears to be moving in a largely wholesome and fluffy direction.  |
|  [As the Yuri Goddess Commands](https://storia.takeshobo.co.jp/manga/yurigamisama/)  |  What would have been a morbid start gets played for laughs. Which I guess is a good sign that this will likely be a mostly light and cute story, with some shenanigans that may or may not basically be the author's self-insert.  |
|  ["I Wanna Touch You", then Love Begins](https://storia.takeshobo.co.jp/manga/furekoi/)  |  Mild drama with some borderline aromantic representation. Otherwise super fluffy.  |
|  [Gal Maid & VIllianess!](https://ichijin-plus.com/comics/140594018976160)  |  Would have been my absolute favourite take on villianess GL if capitalism didn't axe it early. It should have been 30 chapters minimum with the main confession between ch. 18-24. Taking the setting seriously absolutely required a slow-burn romance.  |
|  [Girlfriend Limited to 7 Days](https://comic-walker.com/detail/KC_005863_S/episodes/KC_0058630001400011_E)  |  Trial relationship to real thing, but GL and one side has issues she has never fully resolved. A setting obviously ripe for drama. However this author seemingly loves her happy endings, so hang on tight.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on villianess reincarnation GL so far, more than I'm in Love with the Villianess. Also fairly interesting that PBMMV and ILTV share similar plot driving ideas in later acts.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Intern!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32305)  |  Actual title: "My Intern Bullied Me Again!". This was a really funny find because I found it back-to-back with PBMMV due to looking at the bullying tag. Second-hand embarassment warning.  |
|  [Childhood Sweetheart Liaoliao](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32084)  |  Really sweet read, basically no drama, and super funny find in hindsight. This makes 3 popular GLs where the MC gets together with their (division director level!) boss.  |
|  [Night Owls & Summer Skies](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/night-owls-and-summer-skies/list?title_no=4747)  |  The main couple makes the read worthwhile, but ending is left to your imagination. YMMV on the use of the misunderstood bully trope since it is mostly a myth that functions as apologia for bullies in real life.  |
|  [Winter Before Spring](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/winter-before-spring/list?title_no=6400)  |  Read the blurb, then mull over the title. Despite knowing this, Act 1 will still be very, very painful and heartbreaking. How do people even read stories like The Summer You Were Here without dying of heartbreak?  |
|  [What are the Chances](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/what-are-the-chances/list?title_no=480113)  |  Fun read with some reincarnation shenanigans. YMMV warning: the main couple has an Age Gap (but no minors). (That said, why are people not OK with Age Gap but OK with Status Gap simultaneously!? Status Gaps are equally problematic if the superior is male!)  |
|  [Make Her Mine](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/make-her-mine/list?title_no=916067)  |  This makes me sad because I'm Team Childhood Friend but most commenters are Team New Girl -- and the blurb strongly hints that NG will win. Problem is, everything goes wrong for CF while everything goes right for NG. CF deserves a happy ending and I just want to know what it is.  |
|  [Dallae](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/dallae/list?title_no=8368)  |  Really short story. A slight bit of drama and some fantasy, but the story really only cares about the main couple.  |
|  [Yellow](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/yellow/list?title_no=840112)  |  Imagine dating your favourite streamer and they are as wholesome IRL as on-screen. Pure sugar. No drama.  |
|  [Mage & Demon Queen](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/mage-and-demon-queen/list?title_no=1438)  |  Basically the original GL flagbearer on the site and to some extent, the EN-original community. Not sure why the ending includes Science Babies, but oh well.  |

##  Watch

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Chaser Game Double](https://www.gagaoolala.com/en/videos/3992/chaser-game-w-2024-s01e01)  |  Quite famously a GL spin-off of regular office romance drama Chaser Game. Readers of the manga adaptation find it toxic, but I find it compelling and worthy of the "Drama" tag. YMMV. And do not actually copy these behaviours IRL, please.  |
|  [Ayaka is in Love with Hiroko](https://www.gagaoolala.com/en/videos/4521/ayaka-is-in-love-with-hiroko-2024-s01e01)  |  Another office romance drama. Again, another one where manga readers (this is manga-original BTW) found it toxic. YMMV and again do not copy the less-admirable behaviours IRL, please, for obvious reasons.  |
|  [Hina Logic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl12grj-StM5rf3UOWjX_ZCg)  |  GL spin-off of what was otherwise just a promo anime for a TCG. Magical Girl concept like Nanoha, but more fluffy and more explicit with the GL, especially toward the end.  |
|  [VTuber Legend: How I Went Viral after Forgetting to Turn Off My Stream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JgHA9Q6FiSUTNBm02lGB9Ke)  |  True to the inspiration (HoloLive), there's a lesbian side-couple and then theres some all-girls love triangle business going on.  |
|  [The Magical Revolution of the Reincarnated Princess and the Genius Young Lady](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl39RHrWKdjZJ9hFQ6UYiDMr)  |  MahoRevo is one of those stories that mixes romance with another genre and the romance still comes out strong and absolutely makes sense. The anime adaptation absolutely deserved an S2, but for commercial reality.  |
|  [The Vexations of a Shut-In Vampire Princess](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhGamQZtJ7K8O7i0ypG3qsLtqViTmmjot)  |  First GL Harem I am aware of to be animated in the current era. Unfortunately the YT global release of HikiKomari is time and region locked.  |
|  [There's No Freaking Way I'll be Your Lover! Unless...](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhGamQZtJ7K8yocPHbrtrYmX8NdN6hvOW)  |  THE GL Harem flagbearer of this era with this level of quality release, even though HikiKomari was first to get animated and is actually faithful to the source material. Many hopes and dreams are riding on WataNare to break a major genre glass ceiling by greenlighting S2 covering LN volumes 5-8.  |
|  [This Monster Wants to Eat Me](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7Jj08w5BqJ83bSeTd1DgtpxL)  |  Supernatural horror love triangle GL stuff. No, the gore is actually quite minimal. This is a different kind of series and is really one out there for who relate to existential nihilism and depression.  |

##  Backlog

Consensus is these belong to the genre.

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Fate/Kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA 2wei!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjsjPs89xphZwisLfHCkAny)  |  [TBU after watching] Unclear where season 1 (movie) is officially licensed. In the source material (manga), Fate/Kaleid is one of two spin-offs that are canonically in the genre. Being a Fate series things get dark every so often.  |
|  [Fate/Kaleid liner PRISMA ILLYA 2wei! Herz!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjKvkZM_SA5vMvFSJaOpQ2m)  |  [TBU after watching] Part 3 of Illya's and Miyu's nonsense.  |
|  [Fate/kaleid liner 3rei!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjJznxwWKttm2EI1LpgB1Vc)  |  [TBU after watching] Part 4 of Illya's and Miyu's nonsense.  |
|  [Citrus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7Jg4IP_nznPuJptBvNyXhZsc)  |  THE GL (Pseudo-)Incest flagbearer series (waiting for WataNare to dethrone it, obviously), with all the IRL drama and controversy that involves. Still, that makes this part of the genre's animated canon along with Sakura Trick, Sasameki Koto, and Adachi and Shimamura.  |
|  [Asteroid In Love](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl279Yd4R1ENjMTLDZBSfX1Z)  |  [TBU after watching] High school romance. If the anime adaptation is not GL enough, go read the source material (manga).  |
|  [Stardust Telepath](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3SO7xh3VLjlKKvxihVUOaI)  |  [TBU after watching] Another high school romance. If the anime adaptation is not GL enough, go read the source material (manga).  |
|  [BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3DVtslUyw-MeBR5W7ktk1e)  |  [TBU after watching] Like Love Live!, all BanG Dream! series are so heavily coded that fan base consensus appears to be these belong to the genre.  |
|  [BanG Dream! Ave Mujica](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl322PZfaZqVFMuAmmGGephH)  |  [TBU after watching] Same as MyGO!!!!!, the fan consensus appears to be this is part of the genre.  |
|  [Mobile Suit Gundam: the Witch from Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx_jXtO1GrrS0to_ojc672HG)  |  [TBU after watching] Studio executives may have chickened out, but staff have confirmed that WfM is the first, and to-date only, Gundam series firmly in the genre. Canonically, Suletta and Miorine eventually marry.  |
|  [Bad Girl](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JgjTpwufE53zual7_yHvdzA)  |  [TBU after watching] There's an all-girls love polygon going on, but the comedy overshadows it a bit too much and I believe the source material (manga) hasn't even resolved it.  |

##  Subtext

Consensus is mixed. This is up to interpretation.

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Laid-Back Camp (S1)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7Jh5nBsvSq-SCgEhgSYSdNZl)  |  Unlike some of the other stuff that came later, Yuru Camp is minimally subtext.  |
|  [Laid-Back Camp (S2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JhsFhLkiHzyfMeO5unNiOEc)  |  Unfortunately, the author brings this generally in the camp / friendship direction. The subtext is still there but not really explored.  |
|  [Otherside Picnic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JhuqqXxuJ3FjDyQ0ISzzBZ7)  |  [TBU after watching] The source material (LN) apparently enters the territory firmly late in the series. Low expectations for the first season to go beyond subtext, if even that.  |
|  [NEW GAME!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3guU7C6fmEzgwnIFAnrzk5)  |  [TBU after watching] There is an actual lesbian side-couple, but not so much for the main character, apparently.  |
|  [NEW GAME!!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl2p7OR6zO14pWdZ7DBjUHgS)  |  [TBU after watching] Apparently this is well out of subtext if characters other than MC are considered. Or is it?  |
|  [Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0v47aPkpPwQH7D-WJOJx1L)  |  OP isekai shenanigans except is a girl, in the same vein as Bofuri. The source material (LN) appears to be much clearer that it belongs to the genre.  |
|  [Lapis Re: LiGHTs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3MvMICti5VTiLTHivii-JR)  |  [TBU after watching] Source material (mobile gacha) suggests this is much closer to explicitly being in the genre.  |
|  [Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0t53wDaw_s7IFG7cNLp_BL)  |  [TBU after watching] There may or may not be a crush somewhere in there.  |
|  [MAYONAKA PUNCH](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JgRtxr6-hzpqOVnKDFFVAEt)  |  [TBU after watching] Unclear whether this is firmly in the subtext or not.  |
|  [Luminous Witches](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3myw51ePNETmCVl587h_Y3)  |  As with the rest of the franchise, the animated material stays in the subtext while the written material is way more explicit.  |
|  [Rock is a Lady's Modesty](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjgRVMAKk5LAZB89yQ0h4Xw)  |  [TBU after watching] Consensus seems to be this is subtext in the Bocchi the Rock sense but shipping is very much alive.  |
|  [Umamusume: Pretty Derby (S1)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjzK3AD896WNfsfosMcC6pL)  |  [TBU after watching] The source material (mobile gacha) appears to lean heavily into the genre, but for still having the male self-insert character. The unnecessary self-insert is why I mark this as subtext (i.e., up to your interpretation).  |
|  [Umamusume: Pretty Derby (S2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7Jgj79jI0W9KxvoRwfTGyeIw)  |  [TBU after watching] Again, irritating male self-insert.  |
|  [Umamusume: Pretty Derby (S3)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JhASExBFWxdzJs4ZEruLKun)  |  [TBU after watching] Again, irritating male self-insert.  |
|  [SHY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0e2nQ5MU6dWXVC3Pqf6941)  |  [TBU after watching] The original material (manga) firmly enters the genre at the halfway point. This is a genre shift (although subtext exists from the get-go).  |

##  CGDCT

These could be interpreted as part of the genre, but consensus is this is a stretch. For this list, this is also stretched a bit to include close friendship stuff where the girls don't technically do "cute" things.

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Is the Order a Rabbit?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3Yk31lEtOGELVwz1DuYiDU)  |  Girl moves to new town for high school, where her new boarding house is above a cafe whose owners have a cute daughter. The canonical CGDCT series.  |
|  [ENDRO!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JinVtmqKjJJ_vjL-EEsxF9o)  |  [TBU after watching] All-girl hero party kills the demon king. Demon king reincarnates as a lady and becomes a teacher at the heroes' school. Nonsense ensues.  |
|  [Slow Start](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JgJosm1-H4AXMc6LaGcrqxJ)  |  [TBU after watching] For reasons, girl is held back a year (not due to grades) and transfers to a new high school to start afresh. Despite parallels to Anemone feels the Heat, this is firmly CGDCT.  |
|  [Otaku Elf](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7Jjk5Txg_4MhFPNDx8hdQiS-)  |  [TBU after watching] Young girl becomes a shrine maiden where said deity is real and is actually an elf who reverse-transmigrated to our world centuries ago. CGDCT, unfortunately, after that set-up.  |
|  [Momentary Lily](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3ML-kzI3sjoetbnmSaealc)  |  [TBU after watching] Group of girls do their best to survive and find fellow survivors in a post-apocalypse world. CGDCT / Girls' friendship series.  |
|  [Minami Kamakura High School Girls Cycling Club](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl3lknkYJWO-mDkHIibtlgpQ)  |  [TBU after watching] Appears to be in the same vein as Yuru Camp but firmly on the side of close friends only.  |
|  [The Aquatope on White Sand](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl13ebVE0dgagqzozYJ5d1Er)  |  [TBU after watching] Appears to be another close friendship series.  |
|  [Circlet Princess](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JjPth-hvaz8yZjo_nJ3bJgG)  |  [TBU after watching] Rivals to close friends series.  |
|  [I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense (S1)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0fxMZfFjcKLnL0Hj6cw3Op)  |  Two IRL inseparable BFFs have fun being OP in an MMORPG with fun builds and go on dates here and there. Under a different author, this would be Yuri / GL.  |
|  [I Don't Want to Get Hurt, so I'll Max Out My Defense (S2)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0Kfd0S0D1PELpHYRUz-Owo)  |  Remains firmly in CGDCT territory.  |
|  [See You Tomorrow at the Food Court](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxSscENEp7JhtKJCbR-BlQatFfQ8GGcNz)  |  [TBU after watching] Gal and girl regularly meet up at a food court to chat about life and stuff and mutually affirm that they would happily date a guy that was exactly like the other. Under a different author, this would be Yuri / GL.  |
|  [I've Been Killing Slimes for 300 Years and Maxed Out My Level](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwLSw1_eDZl0M4VrdwW6NbQ-U6TgAVOoE)  |  Girl isekais as OP witch, decides to chill out instead, but acquires a family of OP girls who follow or worship her. Unfortunately, the source material (LN) remains firmly CGDCT.  |
