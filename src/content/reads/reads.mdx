#   Makes the week bearable

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. Both MCs are cute little disasters. Do not read before work.  |
|  [Girlfriend Project](https://tapas.io/series/the-girlfriend-project/info)  |  Cute premise. Not standard romance. Apparently the ending is a downer, as in "why the hell did the author do this".  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Ending makes it worth it. For most of it, keep in mind both MCs grew up in very broken homes.  |
|  [Gal Maid & VIllianess!](https://ichijin-plus.com/comics/140594018976160)  |  Would have been my absolute favourite take on villianess GL if not for the axe of capitalism. It should have been 30 chapters minimum with the main confession between ch. 18-24. Taking the setting seriously absolutely required a slow-burn romance.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on villianess reincarnation GL so far, ahead of I'm in Love with the Villianess. Technically not the same sub-genre since ILTV is villianess GL, not villianess reincarnation.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Intern!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32305)  |  Note: Real EN title is "My Intern Bullied Me Again!" This was a really funny find because I found it back-to-back with PBMMV due to looking at the bullying tag.  |
|  [Childhood Sweetheart Liaoliao](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32084)  |  Super funny find in hindsight. This makes 3 relatively popular GLs where the MC gets together with their (division director level!) boss. Are Manhwa artists trying to say something?  |
