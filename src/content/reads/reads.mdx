#   Makes the week bearable

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. Cute read, relatively minimal drama. The main couple are both cute disasters.  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Some psychological drama, but quite sweet ending given what the set-up is. The psychological stuff comes from both MCs growing up in broken families.  |
|  [Gal Maid & VIllianess!](https://ichijin-plus.com/comics/140594018976160)  |  Would have been my absolute favourite take on villianess GL if capitalism didn't axe it early. It should have been 30 chapters minimum with the main confession between ch. 18-24. Taking the setting seriously absolutely required a slow-burn romance.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on villianess reincarnation GL so far, even moreso than I'm in Love with the Villianess. Also fairly interesting that PBMMV and ILTV share similar plot driving ideas in later acts.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Intern!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32305)  |  Note: Real EN title is "My Intern Bullied Me Again!" This was a really funny find because I found it back-to-back with PBMMV due to looking at the bullying tag. Prepare for second-hand embarassment... from the boss.  |
|  [Childhood Sweetheart Liaoliao](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32084)  |  Really sweet read, basically no drama, and super funny find in hindsight. This makes 3 popular GLs where the MC gets together with their (division director level!) boss.  |
|  [Night Owls & Summer Skies](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/night-owls-and-summer-skies/list?title_no=4747)  |  The main couple makes the read worthwhile, but ending is left to your imagination. YMMV on the use of the misunderstood bully trope since it is mostly a myth that functions as apologia for bullies in real life.  |
|  [Winter Before Spring](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/winter-before-spring/list?title_no=6400)  |  Read the blurb, then mull over the title. Despite knowing this, Act 1 will still be very, very painful and heartbreaking. How do people even read stories like The Summer You Were Here without dying of heartbreak?  |
|  [What are the Chances](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/what-are-the-chances/list?title_no=480113)  |  Fun read with some reincarnation shenanigans. YMMV warning: the main couple has an Age Gap (but no minors). (That said, why are people not OK with Age Gap but OK with Status Gap simultaneously!? Status Gaps are equally problematic if the superior is male!)  |
|  [Make Her Mine](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/make-her-mine/list?title_no=916067)  |  This makes me sad because I'm Team Childhood Friend but most commenters are Team New Girl -- and the blurb strongly hints that NG will win. Problem is, everything goes wrong for CF while everything goes right for NG. CF deserves a happy ending and I just want to know what it is.  |
|  [Dallae](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/dallae/list?title_no=8368)  |  Really short story. A slight bit of drama and some fantasy, but the story really only cares about the main couple.  |
|  [Yellow](https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/yellow/list?title_no=840112)  |  Just started but already love it. Pure sugar, no clue if there's significant drama, if at all.  |
|  [Mage & Demon Queen](https://www.webtoons.com/en/comedy/mage-and-demon-queen/list?title_no=1438)  |  Basically the original GL flagbearer on the site and to some extent, the EN-original community. Not sure why the ending includes Science Babies, but oh well.  |
