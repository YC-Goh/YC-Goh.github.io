#   Makes the week bearable

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. The main pair are both cute little disasters. Do not read before work.  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Ending makes it worth it. For most of it, keep in mind both MCs grew up in very broken homes.  |
|  [Gal Maid & VIllianess!](https://ichijin-plus.com/comics/140594018976160)  |  Would have been my absolute favourite take on villianess GL if capitalism didn't axe it early. It should have been 30 chapters minimum with the main confession between ch. 18-24. Taking the setting seriously absolutely required a slow-burn romance.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on villianess reincarnation GL so far, ahead of I'm in Love with the Villianess. Technically not the same sub-genre since ILTV is villianess GL, not villianess reincarnation.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Intern!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32305)  |  Note: Real EN title is "My Intern Bullied Me Again!" This was a really funny find because I found it back-to-back with PBMMV due to looking at the bullying tag.  |
|  [Childhood Sweetheart Liaoliao](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc32084)  |  Super funny find in hindsight. This makes 3 popular GLs where the MC gets together with their (division director level!) boss.  |
|  [Night Owls & Summer Skies](https://www.webtoons.com/en/romance/night-owls-and-summer-skies/list?title_no=4747)  |  The main pair makes the read worthwhile, but I really do very much hate the use of the misunderstood bully trope. It's a myth that only perpetuates the suffering of victims of bullying in real life.  |
|  [Winter Before Spring](https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/winter-before-spring/list?title_no=6400)  |  The blurb and the title already said it. Act 1 of the story was still incredibly painful to read. Had to blast through it, otherwise I'd be crying on the train. How do people even read stories like The Summer You Were Here without dying of heartbreak?  |
