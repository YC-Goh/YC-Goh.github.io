#   Makes the week bearable

|  \{w-1/4\}Title  |  Description  |
|  ----  |  ----  |
|  [Straight Girl Trap](https://tapas.io/series/straight-girl-trap/)  |  Title drop on first chapter. Both MCs are cute little disasters. Do not read before work.  |
|  [Girlfriend Project](https://tapas.io/series/the-girlfriend-project/info)  |  Cute premise. Not standard romance. Apparently the ending is a downer, as in "why the hell did the author do this".  |
|  [I Love Amy](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/book/i-love-amy)  |  Ending makes it worth it. For most of it, keep in mind both MCs grew up in very broken homes.  |
|  [Please Bully Me, Miss Villainess!](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30716)  |  The most-loved take on the villianess reincarnation genre on the GL side so far. Ahead of I'm in Love with the Villianess. Also technically not the same sub-genre anyway (the reincarnated is the villianess in PBMMV vs the heroine in ILTV).  |
