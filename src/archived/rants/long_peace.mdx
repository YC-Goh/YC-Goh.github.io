#   Good things like peace never last

##  2025 Israel-Iran War

-   Israel's war to lose.
-   Global and US public opinion backing is practically assured. 
-   "Pre-emptive self-defence" as moral pretext for Just War will be irreversibly normalised.
-   A lot of idiots _do not_ comprehend how low this lowers the bar for war.

##  Nuclear non-proliferation is dead

-   Russo-Ukrainian War:
    Ukrainian efforts to obtain foreign aid and weapons purchases was crippled by the West's fear of Russia's nuclear shield. 
-   Israel-Iran War:
    Israel dared to strike because it knew Iran _did not have a nuclear shield_,
    hence there was no credible deterrent or retaliation.
    -   Note: 
        Israel claims Iran is an existential threat.
        Nothing is an existential threat to the empire that has America as its client state.
-   Korean Armistice:
    South Korea has historically never retaliated against North Korea's salami slicing tactics _because of_ the nuclear shield.
    -   With declining American credibility as a security guarantor,
        South Korea has to now consider building its own second-strike capability to forestall the inevitable restart of war.

##  The Non-Proliferation Treaty is a massive mistake in hindsight

-   Non-signatories with withdrawers were rewarded in the 21st century.
    -   North Korea, Israel, India, Pakistan
-   Signatories and states that carried out their legal obligations were punished for it.
    -   Ukraine, Iran, Syria
    -   Acceding to nuclear inspections by the IAEA is now a national security risk
-   Nuclear shields have been weaponised to suppress adversary and client states.
    -   Russia, Israel
-   Liberals hoped that economic growth and global economic integration would yield a positive feedback loop to reinforce peace.
    -   Turns out, this was hopelessly optimistic.
    -   Humanity could not escape its evolutionary roots as monkeys with highly-developed brains and an incredible appetite for power and violence.

##  Pax Americana is over

-   America is now irreversibly an authoritarian state.
    -   An electorate that elected Trump twice will absolutely elect another authoritarian.
-   America has essentially abandoned NATO.
    -   The _formal_ structures remain but best not test whether those structures have foundations.
-   America's pivot to the Pacific has no visible grand alliance strategy.
    -   Instead it looks like Colonial Era Great Power games.
    -   No longer clear if American protection is any better than Chinese dominance.

##  China is a true imperialist power

-   "American Imperialism" contrarians are about to receive a huge shock from Chinese behaviour this century,
    provided they have the capacity to learn and be shamed.
-   China continually tests and contests air, sea, and border control of all states in its Sphere of Influence.
-   Theory of Revealed Preference:
    This is _not_ how a peaceful great power behaves.

##  India is also a shithole

-   India is neither liberal nor democratic despite the _formal_ structures of liberal democracy.
-   Positive narratives of India are pushed because there are no other credible counterweights to China in Asia.
