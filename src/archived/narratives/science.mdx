|  ['Harm' must not be redefined by US conservation agencies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01921-3)  |  Pity the scientist that still has hope for conservation science in the USA.  |

But RFK, Jr., Isn't Pursuing Them](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-actions-could-make-vaccines-safer-but-rfk-jr-isnt-pursuing-them)  |  The standard format of popular science reporting, giving your opponents equal voice no matter the total weight of evidence, does itself no favours. Anyway, the USA deserves zero public health policy.  |

|  [See what summer in your city could feel like by the end of the century](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/features/2025/climate-matches)  |  Genuinely fucked that this is what regards need to take Global Warming seriously. Even then, this vastly undersells the problem because it is not just how hot Summer is.  |
