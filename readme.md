# Hello!

Welcome to the repo for my [personal website](https://yc-goh.github.io).
This is being maintained entirely as a hobby side project / living portfolio / coding practice exercise.
I will be trying to maintain this near-daily from now on.

# GohYC#### / YC-Goh

This links together things under this username (where not already taken by others). 
Everyone has their own private usernames, so similarly you will not find mine here.

# AI Coding Buddy Usage

I will get there one day. 
For now, the purpose of this project is to shore up my fundamental knowledge of JS / HTML / CSS under the Next.JS + TailwindCSS stack.

# Dynamic Content

I will get there one day.
For now, this website is fully static and pre-rendered server-side.
